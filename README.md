üèéÔ∏è **DriveToSurvive
A Decentralized Motorsport Ecosystem Built on Transparency, Merit & Fan Power**
**Overview**

DriveToSurvive reimagines Formula 1 as a transparent, data-driven, and fair ecosystem powered by blockchain.
It uses smart contracts, oracles, and NFTs to ensure that driver success is based on performance ‚Äî not politics or money.
Fans, sponsors, and teams interact through an open, verifiable platform where every contribution and reward is recorded on-chain.

**Problem Statement**

Modern Formula 1 faces three major issues:

Team Politics: Drivers are often prioritized based on internal favoritism, not on-track results.

Sponsor Bias: Wealthy backers influence seat decisions, leaving talented drivers sidelined.

Fan Disconnect: Fans lack meaningful engagement or influence beyond passive support.

These issues compromise meritocracy, transparency, and the true spirit of competition in motorsport.

**Solution**

DriveToSurvive introduces a decentralized motorsport model where:

Smart Contracts handle driver-team agreements and sponsor funding transparently.

NFTs represent drivers and evolve based on real performance metrics.

Pyth Oracles provide real-time valuation updates linked to driver performance.

Avail Nexus SDK enables cross-chain sponsorships and seamless fund transfers.

Blockscout Integration ensures full transparency for every transaction and contract interaction.

This creates a fair, data-driven ecosystem where performance determines value ‚Äî and fans, not politics, fuel the sport‚Äôs growth.
